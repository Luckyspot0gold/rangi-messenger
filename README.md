"The Oracle of Rangi - An AWS-powered AI Agent that translates market data into multi-sensory intuition. Official entry for the AWS Agent Hackathon."
# The Oracle of Rangi ðŸŽµ

> An AI Agent that doesn't just tell you about the marketâ€”it lets you *feel* it.

**Official Submission for the [AWS Agent Hackathon](https://aws-agent-hackathon.devpost.com/)**

## The Vision

The Oracle of Rangi is a multi-sensory AI agent built on **AWS Bedrock and Lambda**. It transforms complex financial data into intuitive sonic and haptic feedback, making market intuition accessible to everyoneâ€”especially the visually impaired.

## How It Works

1.  **You Ask:** "Is it a good time to buy Bitcoin?"
2.  **Bedrock Understands:** AWS Bedrock parses your question and intent.
3.  **Dr. Dee Analyzes:** The agent core (using logic from `Frontier-Trader`) fetches and analyzes market data.
4.  **The Heart Responds:** Our proprietary **7-Bell H.R.I.** model (from `Rangi's Heartbeat`) generates a sensory signature.
5.  **You Feel the Answer:** You receive a text analysis + a unique sound and vibration pattern that conveys the market's true state.

## Technology Stack

- **AI & Reasoning:** [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) (Claude 3 Haiku)
- **Serverless Logic:** [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
- **Sensory Engine:** Proprietary 7-Bell Harmonic Resonance Index (H.R.I.)
- **Frontend:** Simple Web Interface (HTML/JS)

## Getting Started

1.  Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Luckyspot0gold/rangi-oracle.git`
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Deploy the Lambda function: (See /aws-integration/README.md for detailed instructions)
4.  Run the simple demo frontend to test the agent.

## How Rangi's Heartbeat Creates Unbreakable Trust in Market Data

### **Verifiable Data Integrity**
Our recursive security protocol ensures that every market data point can be cryptographically proven:
- **Multi-layered encryption** creates an immutable chain of trust
- **Recursive validation** continuously verifies data authenticity
- **Quantum-resistant algorithms** future-proof against emerging threats

### **Zero-Knowledge Verification**
Using zkTLS technology, we can prove:
- Market data authenticity without revealing proprietary analysis algorithms
- Trading pattern validity without exposing user strategies
- System integrity without compromising security [citation:2]
